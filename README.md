# Adobe Experience Manager template for Tugboat

This is a configuration file for building live previews of AEM on [Tugboat CI](https://www.tugboat.ci/) for every pull or merge request.

## Prerequisites

1. You'll need an account on Tugboat. The free tiers most likely won't have enough RAM to run AEM. Instead, request a trial of at least a "Plus" tier.
2. You'll need the aem jar file from Adobe and a license. See [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/deploy.html?lang=en#advanced-deployment) for details. 

## Installation

1. Fork this repository and create a new project in [Tugboat](https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/).
2. Environment Variables.
